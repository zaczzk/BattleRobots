# BattleRobots — Project Roadmap

## Vision
A physics-driven robot combat game built in Unity. Players assemble modular robots,
enter battle arenas, earn currency from wins, and unlock upgraded parts. All physics
uses ArticulationBody exclusively. The economy, save system, and event bus are SO-driven.

---

## Architecture Rules (enforced every session)
- **ArticulationBody only** — never Rigidbody for robot parts
- **No heap allocations** in Update / FixedUpdate
- **SO Event Channels** for all cross-component communication
- **SO assets immutable at runtime** — write only through designated mutator methods
- **XOR SaveSystem** for all persistence (MatchRecord, Wallet snapshot)
- **BattleRobots.UI** must never reference **BattleRobots.Physics**
- **PlayerWallet**: SO for runtime state, MatchRecord for persistence
- Namespaces: `BattleRobots.Core` / `BattleRobots.Physics` / `BattleRobots.UI` / `BattleRobots.Editor`

## Active Backlog (RICE-ordered)

| ID | Task | RICE | Status | DoD |
|----|------|------|--------|-----|
| T001 | SO Event Channel system (GameEvent<T>, Listener) | 90 | **In Progress** | Compiles; no Update allocs; unit-testable |
| T002 | PlayerWallet ScriptableObject | 85 | Pending | SO mutates via AddFunds/Deduct; fires event |
| T003 | MatchRecord data class + JSON shape | 85 | Pending | Serializable; round-trips clean |
| T004 | XOR SaveSystem (save/load MatchRecord) | 80 | Pending | Encrypts file on disk; loads back intact |
| T005 | RobotDefinition SO (part slots, base stats) | 75 | **Done** | Compiles; slots validated in Editor |
| T006 | ArticulationBody joint wrapper (HingeJointAB) | 75 | **Done** | Drive applies torque; no Rigidbody |
| T007 | DamageSystem — HealthSO + DamageEvent channel | 70 | **Done** | Damage reduces health SO; death event fires |
| T008 | Arena scene scaffold (ground, walls, spawn points) | 60 | **Done** | Scene loads; robots spawn at markers |
| T009 | ShopUI — part browser, buy button, wallet display | 55 | Pending | UI reads wallet SO; buy fires deduct |
| T010 | MatchManager — round timer, win condition | 55 | **Done** | Correct winner determined; MatchRecord written |
| T011 | MainMenu + LoadingScreen UI | 40 | Pending | Scene transitions work; no GC in Update |
| T012 | VFX: impact sparks, destruction explosion | 30 | Pending | Pooled particles; zero alloc |

## In Progress

| Task | Owner | Started | Notes |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
| T009 — ShopUI | PM Agent | 2026-04-07 | Next: part browser panel, buy button, wallet balance label — all wired to PlayerWallet SO via IntGameEventListener |

---

## Completed

| Task | Completed | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| T001 — SO Event Channel system | 2026-04-05 | GameEvent<T>, VoidGameEvent, typed listeners (Float, Int, Void) |
| T002 — PlayerWallet SO | 2026-04-05 | AddFunds/Deduct; fires IntGameEvent on balance change |
| T003 — MatchRecord + SaveData | 2026-04-05 | Serializable POCO; round-trips through JsonUtility |
| T004 — XOR SaveSystem | 2026-04-05 | Atomic write via temp file; XOR key 0xAB |
| T005 — RobotDefinition SO | 2026-04-06 | PartSlot list, base stats; Editor drawer with slot validation |
| T006 — HingeJointAB | 2026-04-06 | RevoluteJoint ArticulationBody wrapper; SetTargetVelocity / ApplyTorque |
| T007 — DamageSystem | 2026-04-06 | HealthSO + DamageInfo struct + DamageGameEvent channel + DamageReceiver |
| T008 — Arena scene scaffold | 2026-04-07 | ArenaConfig SO (ground/wall dims, SpawnPointData list), SpawnPointMarker MB (Gizmo), ArenaManager MB (HandleMatchStarted positions robots). Scene assets deferred to Editor session. |
| T010 — MatchManager | 2026-04-07 | Round timer in Update (no allocs), death/expiry win conditions, MatchRecord written via SaveSystem, wallet rewarded via PlayerWallet SO, _onMatchEnded VoidGameEvent raised. |

## Session Log

| Date | Agent | Summary |
|------|-------|---------|
| 2026-04-05 | PM Agent | Session 1: Repo bootstrap. Created ROADMAP.md, .gitignore, folder structure, Core SO event channel system (GameEvent, VoidGameEvent, GameEventListenerT), PlayerWallet SO, MatchRecord, XOR SaveSystem. |
| 2026-04-06 | PM Agent | Session 2: T005 RobotDefinition SO (PartSlot, PartCategory, ValidateSlots, Editor drawer). T006 HingeJointAB (RevoluteJoint, SetTargetVelocity, ApplyTorque, no Rigidbody). T007 DamageSystem (DamageInfo struct, DamageGameEvent channel, DamageGameEventListener, HealthSO with FloatGameEvent/VoidGameEvent channels, DamageReceiver bridging events to HealthSO). M1 fully complete; M2 core Physics in place. |
| 2026-04-07 | PM Agent | Session 3: T008 Arena scaffold (ArenaConfig SO, SpawnPointMarker MB with Gizmos, ArenaManager MB). T010 MatchManager (round timer, death/expiry win conditions, MatchRecord persistence, wallet rewards, VoidGameEvent channels). M3 core loop complete in C#; scene asset wiring deferred to Editor session. |

## Session Handoff

**Last completed:** T008 (ArenaConfig SO + SpawnPointMarker + ArenaManager), T010 (MatchManager)  
**Next action:** T009 — ShopUI. C# deliverables (no Editor needed):
  - `PartDefinition.cs` SO (BattleRobots.Core) — part identity, category, cost, thumbnail
  - `ShopCatalog.cs` SO (BattleRobots.Core) — list of PartDefinitions available for purchase
  - `ShopManager.cs` (BattleRobots.UI) — reads ShopCatalog + PlayerWallet SO; exposes BuyPart(PartDefinition) method; fires VoidGameEvent on purchase; UI wiring deferred to Editor session
  
**Blockers:** None for C# work. All scene/prefab/.unity asset creation deferred until Editor session.  
**Architecture notes:**
- `PartDefinition` and `ShopCatalog` → `BattleRobots.Core` (pure data SOs)
- `ShopManager` → `BattleRobots.UI` namespace; must NOT reference BattleRobots.Physics
- Wire PlayerWallet balance changes to UI label via `IntGameEventListener` in Inspector
- ArenaManager and MatchManager both receive MatchStarted via `VoidGameEventListener` MB on same GO; Response wired to `HandleMatchStarted()` in Inspector
- MatchManager `_arenaIndex` field: assign from ArenaConfig.ArenaIndex at runtime (or wire in Inspector) to keep MatchRecord consistent
